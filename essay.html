                <div class="box1">Chinese lawyers</div>
                <div class="box2">Chinese lawyers must be familiar with this poem, which is the inscription given by Comrade Hu Qiaomu for the First National Congress of Lawyers. There are not many words, but they are transparent to the back of the paper! It conveys the
                    faith, persistence, confidence and pursuit of lawyers! This poem has made countless students like warriors enter the job of lawyers, and has also created a batch of outstanding Chinese barristers! It is like a trumpet that awakens
                    the dream of the legal master of the ancient land of China! China's rule of law process is slowly moving forward! This poem made young Chinese lawyers forget the difficulties of survival in the legal profession, and made lawyers more
                    proud and proud! Let the lawyer keep his head high and temperament even though he has won many battles! To this day, this poem still has a strong vitality and appeal, allowing groups of lawyers to enter the courtroom! Go to the battlefield
                    of life! No matter how the times change, Chinese lawyers should still adhere to their ideals and insist on using the law to write their lives! We also hope that this poem can lead more aspiring people to join the ranks of lawyers!</div>

                <div class="box1">A person</div>
                <div class="box2">A person who came to this familiar and unfamiliar city, Wudu, may be the origin of the cha bed, and he could not sleep for a long time late at night. The details have been constantly swirling around day and night in the past few years...
                    I can't forget the scorching heat and sweating, I still sit at my desk, swimming in the ocean of knowledge, I can't forget the situation of staying in a cheap hotel and preparing for the battle in the dim light in order to save money
                    during the exams, let alone the strange eyes of those young candidates looking at me, a candidate who is about to enter the year of confusion....... The four-year history of struggle seems to be a long time, and it seems to be yesterday,
                    and now I am lying on my bed thinking about the years that I have wasted, and I am glad that I can wake up on that sleepless night four years ago. Well, keep up the good work, on your own way!</div>

                <div class="box1">it is just bathing?</div>
                <div class="box2">Although this is an image, and it is just bathing, and there is no other behavior, for adults, the mind is already sound and will not be affected much psychological impact; But for minors, it is different, the mental development of children
                    is not yet mature, for this situation of bathing naked in public may have a negative effect on them, if this situation is not properly condemned, let this situation occur everywhere, then it will also have a bad impact on the entire
                    social atmosphere. Therefore, I believe that appropriate penalties should be imposed for such acts. So I looked through China's "Public Security Administration Punishment Law", in which only Article 23 (2) can be applied, that is,
                    "disrupting the order of stations, ports, docks, airports, shopping malls, parks, exhibition halls or other public places; "may be punished as follows" shall be given a warning or a fine of up to 200 yuan; where the circumstances are
                    more serious, they shall be detained for not less than 5 days but not more than 10 days, and may also be fined not more than 500 yuan." In this case, a warning or fine from the merchant is appropriate</div>

                <div class="box1">In court</div>
                <div class="box2">In court, the judge said that he was very familiar with the insurance company, which is quite normal, the insurance company has dozens or even hundreds of traffic accident cases a month, and on average there are several or even dozens
                    of them in a court, and the court has so many traffic accident judges, how can it be unfamiliar. Generally speaking, the judge still speaks for the injured party, at least today this judge is very good, many times to fight for our
                    interests, with words to call the insurance company to stop, the compensation should be compensated. Now in the case of traffic accidents, the general vehicle side has insurance, as long as the injury is not too serious, basically
                    the insurance company compensation, so many cases are closed by mediation, which is not only conducive to the injured party to quickly receive the enforcement money, but also enables the insurance company to get some concessions, and
                    is conducive to the court to quickly close the case to reduce the burden of litigation and save judicial resources, which is not bad.</div>
